When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-when I work on couple different computers, collaborate with others, want to show sb my code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-If git do that automatically the it could mess up my files when I'm editing them

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- fork - another version of some github repository, at first tis is exactly the same as ancestor - it is useful when you want to change or propose changes to a owner of repository which you don't allowed to change
- clone - is a your local version of repository - it is useful when you want to program and you suppose that Internet connection is going to be off
- branches - is different version of code in repository it is often use to make some experimental changes

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- fast-forward merges will be allowed 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-providing changes would be easier and faster
-looking for changes and noticing the changes would be harder especially when sth went wrong

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
